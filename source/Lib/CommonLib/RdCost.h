1.    INTRODUCTION

The Fraunhofer Software Library VVdec (“Fraunhofer Versatile Video Decoding Library”) is software that implements (parts of) the Versatile Video Coding Standard - ITU-T H.266 | MPEG-I - Part 3 (ISO/IEC 23090-3) and related technology. 
The standard contains Fraunhofer patents as well as third-party patents. Patent licenses from third party standard patent right holders may be required for using the Fraunhofer Versatile Video Decoding Library. It is in your responsibility to obtain those if necessary. 

The Fraunhofer Versatile Video Decoding Library which mean any source code provided by Fraunhofer are made available under this software copyright license. 
It is based on the official ITU/ISO/IEC VVC Test Model (VTM) reference software whose copyright holders are indicated in the copyright notices of its source files. The VVC Test Model (VTM) reference software is licensed under the 3-Clause BSD License and therefore not subject of this software copyright license.

2.    COPYRIGHT LICENSE

Internal use of the Fraunhofer Versatile Video Decoding Library, in source and binary forms, with or without modification, is permitted without payment of copyright license fees for non-commercial purposes of evaluation, testing and academic research. 

No right or license, express or implied, is granted to any part of the Fraunhofer Versatile Video Decoding Library except and solely to the extent as expressly set forth herein. Any commercial use or exploitation of the Fraunhofer Versatile Video Decoding Library and/or any modifications thereto under this license are prohibited.
